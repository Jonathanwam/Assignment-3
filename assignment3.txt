Assignment 3
Due (attached to an email) before class on Tuesday, February 9th.
This assignment adds to the code written for assignment 2.
Define a “struct” which contains a pointer to a string (this will later be regarded
as a “key”), and an integer to be used for counting occurrences. Instances of
this “struct” will typically be allocated from the heap and strung together as a
singly-linked list with a terminating NULL pointer. Therefore, it will also need to
contain a pointer to another “struct” of its own type.
Modify your “word” program as follows:
1. Define the data structure item described above.
2. As your code extracts words from a file using getNextWord(), rather
than printing them to stdout, linearly search a existing linked list of
key/value pairs for the word as a key. If the word is found in the list,
increment the associated integer counter value. If not, construct a new
instance of the “struct”, place a pointer to the word in it as the key and
initialize the integer counter to one. Attach the new “struct” to the linked
list.
3. After the last file has been read and getNextWord() has returned NULL,
traverse the linked list of “structs”, printing out the words (keys) and
their associated occurrence counts to stdout, one pair per line. Use the
following printf format for printing: "%10d %s\n" .
